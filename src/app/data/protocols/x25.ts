  category: "Network",
  difficulty: "Advanced",
  shortDescription: "Legacy packet-switched WAN protocol used before modern IP networks.",
  fullDescription:
    "X.25 is an ITU-T standard protocol suite for packet-switched networks, developed in the 1970s. It provided reliable, connection-oriented communication over public data networks (PDNs). X.25 was widely used by banks, airlines, and government systems before being largely replaced by Frame Relay, ATM, and IP-based networks.",
  port: "Operates at network layer (no TCP/UDP)",
  versions: ["ITU-T X.25 (1976, updated multiple times)"],
  advantages: [
    "Highly reliable packet switching",
    "Global deployment during 1980sâ€“1990s",
    "Connection-oriented service with error correction"
  ],
  disadvantages: [
    "High latency compared to IP",
    "Obsolete in modern Internet",
    "Low throughput (64 kbps typical)"
  ],
  useCases: [
    "Legacy banking terminals",
    "Point-of-sale (POS) systems",
    "Airline reservation systems",
    "Military/government communications (historical)"
  ],

    }
  ],
  securityConsiderations: [
    "No built-in encryption or authentication",
    "Obsolete and vulnerable compared to IPsec/TLS",
    "Still may exist in legacy critical systems"
