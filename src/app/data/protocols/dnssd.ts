    shortDescription: "Mechanism for discovering services on a local network using DNS records.",
    fullDescription:
        "DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) is a standard that uses DNS records to advertise and discover services on a network. It is often used with Multicast DNS (mDNS) to enable zero-configuration networking (Zeroconf). Appleâ€™s Bonjour and many IoT devices rely on DNS-SD to announce services like printers, file sharing, or AirPlay devices.",
    port: "Typically UDP 5353 (with mDNS)",
    versions: ["RFC 6763"],
    advantages: [
        "Human-friendly service discovery",
        "Works with existing DNS infrastructure",
        "Zero-configuration networking with mDNS"
    ],
    disadvantages: [
        "Can expose services unintentionally",
        "Relies on multicast in local networks",
        "Not ideal for large-scale enterprise deployments"
    ],
    useCases: [
        "Home and office printer discovery",
        "IoT device service advertisement",
        "Apple Bonjour / AirPlay",
        "Zero-config file sharing"

    securityConsiderations: [
